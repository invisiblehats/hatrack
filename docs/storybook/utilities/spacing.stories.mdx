# Spacing

## Margin and padding

Assign responsive-friendly `margin` or `padding` values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes. Includes support for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties. Classes are built from a default Sass map ranging from `.25rem` to `3rem`.

Using the CSS Grid layout module? Consider using [the gap utility](?path=/docs/utilties-gap-overview--page).

### Notation

Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from `xs` to `xxl`, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from `min-width: 0` and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.

The classes are named using the format `{property}{sides}-{size}` for `xs` and `{property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}` for `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`.

Where *property* is one of:

- `m` - for classes that set `margin`
- `p` - for classes that set `padding`

Where *sides* is one of:

- `t` - for classes that set `margin-top` or `padding-top`
- `b` - for classes that set `margin-bottom` or `padding-bottom`
- `s` - (start) for classes that set `margin-left` or `padding-left` in LTR, `margin-right` or `padding-right` in RTL
- `e` - (end) for classes that set `margin-right` or `padding-right` in LTR, `margin-left` or `padding-left` in RTL
- `x` - for classes that set both `*-left` and `*-right`
- `y` - for classes that set both `*-top` and `*-bottom`
- blank - for classes that set a `margin` or `padding` on all 4 sides of the element

Where *size* is one of:

- `0` - for classes that eliminate the `margin` or `padding` by setting it to `0`
- `1` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * .25`
- `2` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * .5`
- `3` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer`
- `4` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * 1.5`
- `5` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * 3`
- `6` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * X`
- `7` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * X`
- `8` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * X`
- `9` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * X`
- `10` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * X`
- `auto` - for classes that set the `margin` to auto
